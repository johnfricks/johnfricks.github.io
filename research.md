A collection of J Fricks' research projects<br>

content: My research covers a variety of biological systems and mathematical tools.  A unifying theme is the study of stochastic dynamics applied to these systems through time or space or both.  My recent research can be categorized into three broad areas.  Molecular motors are protein structures that transport cargos, such as organelles, through the cell.  Diffusion in biological fluids presents a number of challenges including a mix of diffusion and binding as well as diffusion in protein rich fluids that exhibit non-standard stochastic behavior, including non-Markovian dynamics.  I have also worked on disease dynamics both at the intracellular level and whole country population level.
